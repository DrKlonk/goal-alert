# Atalanta Goal Alert

As part of a bet I needed to notify my friends every time football club [Atalanta Bergamo](https://www.atalanta.it/en/) scores a goal. Instead of watching everything and sending whats app messages, I decided to make an app for it.

## Overview

### The app

Users need to:
- Get notifications when Atalanta Bergamo scores a goal
- See upcoming and finished matches

To install:
You can check out the code, but won't be able to run it, since you'd need connection to the MongoDB, a football data token and a webpush private key which I'd rather keep to myself. Please don't check out the entire history of this repository and the lack of adding the .env to the gitignore file. But if you are reading this and then still overload my API token which would crash the app, then shame on you.

### What I learned

#### Keeping a server up
The thing I struggled with the most was keeping my server up and running. I need this, because I want the server to have the most up to date info on a visit/refresh every time. It was perfectly possible to get a server up (even though this was my first time using Heroku for a project like this), but it would sleep after half an hour on a free plan.

Solution: ping it. Much easier than I thought it would be.

I first thought it would be a good idea to let the service worker (SW) do that (spoiler: bad idea), because it keeps running. It did not work. It would ping it from different locations. Also, it would need machines to be on, which might not be the case. The SW should not be responsible for keeping a server up.

I tried separating FE and BE into different projects, but that did NOT magically keep the server up. I hosted my separate server on [Glitch](https://glitch.com) as well for a while, but it turned out that it goes to sleep there as well on a free plan. Who would've thought.

I ended up finding a video on [Pingability](https://pingability.com/) when googling "how to keep a heroku server up for free" (in one of my brighter moments) and implemented that. When I was about to have to pay for that as well, I switched to [StatusCake](https://statuscake.com), which did the job in the end.

I refactored the server twice and ended up rewriting the notifications code as well.


#### Refactoring
I also redid the whole frontend after doing a course on CSS, making it nice and flexboxy. I like my trick to have different ways of showing the teams. I copied this style from [LiveScore](https://livescore.com)

I did not get rid of the whole 20-zeroes-feel of the design though. Maybe I should add some MS Word art to it for fun.

### Continued development

- [ ] Add testing for the notifications
- [ ] Ring a sound (not just a vibration) when Atalanta Scores
